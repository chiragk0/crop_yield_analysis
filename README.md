# Crop Yield Analysis

### Motivation
<p>Hardworking farmers have served as the backbone of the world food chain and have nourished us all for thousands of years; however, they have the lowest annual family incomes of any U.S. wage and salary workers. This is an issue that is not only prevalent in the United States, but across the world. Hence, I wanted to try my hand at alleviating this problem using data science to help farmers optimize crop growth.
